	<p>This is an authenticated route. It is protected by ember-simple-auth.</p>
	<p>This demo application has no real protected data as it is setup as a real offline-first application.</p>
	<p>If you want to protect data from being read by unauthenticated users you need a different database setup. If all your data should be read protected setup couch security to require a role. If some data needs to public and only some data is private you need a separate couch database. Look for details on these and other setups here: <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-authentication#couchdb-authentication-recipes">https://github.com/nolanlawson/pouchdb-authentication#couchdb-authentication-recipes</a></p>
